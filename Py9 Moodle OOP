Build a simple class called Dog.

The class should initialize every instance of Dog created to start with the following:
Attribute 	Value of attribute:
name 	Fido
tricks 	empty list



Build a function named change_name that accepts a parameter. The parameter provided will be used to overwrite the dog's initialized name.

Build another function named new_trick that accepts a parameter. The parameter should be appended to the empty list of tricks that each dog is initialized with.

Build a conversion to string function (hint: Think of the double underscore) that returns a string in the following format:
"My dog's name is __. __ can perform the following tricks: __"      (NOTE: Fill in the blank lines with the dog name and list of tricks)

class Dog:    
    def __init__(self, name='Fido', tricks=[]):
        self.name= name
        self.tricks= tricks
    def change_name(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def new_trick(self, trick):
        self.tricks.append(trick)
    def __str__(self):
        return(f"My dog's name is {self.name}. {self.name} can perform the following tricks: {self.tricks}")
        
Create a class called Car. When initializing a Car instance, the user must provide the year, make, model, color, trim, and transmission type, in that order. The class should also include a conversion to string function that returns a string formatted in the example output provided below (NOTE: the format must be the same to include all whitespaces).

For example, calling car1 = Car('2024','Honda','Civic','White','EX','Automatic')

and 

print(car1) should return:

Year: 2024
Make: Honda
Model: Civic
Color: White
Trim: EX
Transmission: Automatic

class Car:
    def __init__(self, year, make, model, color, trim, transmission):
        self.year = year
        self.make= make
        self.model = model
        self.color = color
        self.trim = trim
        self.transmission = transmission
    def __str__(self):
        return(f'Year: {self.year}\nMake: {self.make}\nModel: {self.model}\nColor: {self.color}\nTrim: {self.trim}\nTransmission: {self.transmission}')
        
Create a class named Chest that can store a large number of items in to a list for an explorer. When initializing a Chest instance, it can store a variable number of items. The chest has a function called add that can store an additional random number of items. It also has a function called drop that can remove a variable number of items from the chest. The empty function removes all the items inside the chest. When you print the chest instance, it will return Chest: [itemX, itemY, itemZ].

For example, by calling chest1 = Chest('swords', 'bows', 'daggers') and then print(chest1), it will return Chest: ['swords', 'bows', 'daggers'].

class Chest:
    def __init__(self, *items):
        self.items = list(items)
    def add(self,*item):
        self.items.extend(item)
    def drop(self,*items):
        for item in items:
            if item in self.items:
                self.items.remove(item)
    def empty(self):
        self.items.clear()
    def __str__(self):
        return(f'Chest: {self.items}')
