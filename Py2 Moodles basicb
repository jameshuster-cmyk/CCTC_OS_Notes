PYTHON 2 MOODLEs

Store the following values in the corresponding variables and print them one by one. 
Variable Name 	Value
s 	"string example"
x  	20
y 	20.0

s= "string example"
x= 20
y= 20.0

print(s)
print(x)
print(y)

Create a variable called x and store 1000 in it. Create another variable called y and store 582 in it. Create a third variable called z with the value x - y. Print z.

x = 1000
y = 582
z = (x-y)

print(z)

Create a variable s and store the string "Python" in it. Multiply the string by 10 and print the result

s= "Python"
print(s*10)

Given the following variables, add them together and store the value in z, print z. 
x = 20
y = 10

x = 20
y= 10

z = (x+y)
print(z)

Using the type() and print() functions, print what type 50 is in python.

print(type(50))

Print the boolean value of 1
print(True)

Given x as a string, convert it to an integer and multiply it by 10. Store the results of the multiplication into another variable of your choosing and then print it.
 
Next, convert the answer back into a string and use the type() function to print what type of object is stored in the variable after the conversion has been performed.

x = '20'
var1 = int(x) * 10
print(var1)
var2 = str(var1)
print(type(var2))

Assign the following two lists to any variable names you like. Add the two lists together and print the combination.

[1,2,3,4,5]
["hi","hello","hey"]

list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
list2 = ["hi","hello","hey"]
print(list1 + list2)

How can you use python list indexing to print the 7th item of the following list?
li = [1,"two",3,"four",5,"six",7,"eight"]

print(li[6])

Using the built in .count() function/method, print how many 3s are in the following tuple:
tup = (1,2,3,3,4,5,3,3,5,3,4,3,3,3,2,3,33,3,3,33,3,4,5,6,77,6,6,5,54,4,3,3,32,2,2,23)

tup = (1,2,3,3,4,5,3,3,5,3,4,3,3,3,2,3,33,3,3,33,3,4,5,6,77,6,6,5,54,4,3,3,32,2,2,23)
print(tup.count(3))

Extend the following list lst1 to the given tuple tup1. Print the tuple.
lst1 = [1,2,3,4,5] 
tup1 = ("one","two","three","four","five")
Hint:  Are tuples mutable? 
One more hint: Are you printing a tuple or a list?

lst1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
tup1 = ("one","two","three","four","five")
combo = tup1 + tuple(lst1)
print(combo)

Using a string method, write a script to convert the following string to a list where each word is located in its own index. Print the list.

Example:
string = "Turn this into a list."
Output:  ['Turn', 'this', 'into', 'a', 'list.']

string = "Turn this into a list."
lst1 = string.split()
print(lst1)

Change the 3rd index of the given list li to the letter 't'. Then use a string method to convert it into a single string and print it.

li = ["F","e","e","d"]
li[3] = "t"
var1 = "".join(li)
print(var1)

Replace the letter a, with b. Count how many b's are in the string.
string: "abbbabbbaaaabaabaababcabababaaabaababcabababbabbbcaabababacbababababababababababa"

string = "abbbabbbaaaabaabaababcabababaaabaababcabababbabbbcaabababacbababababababababababa"
x = string.replace("a" , "b")
y = x.count("b")
print(y)

Use python to produce code below that will create several named variables with the specified value:
Variable 	Value 	Type
hello 	"hello" 	string
is_python_awesome 	True 	boolean
days_in_python 	6 	integer
pie_size 	3.14 	float

After creating all variables and assigning their value, print each variable on a separate line

hello = "hello"
is_python_awesome = bool(True)
days_in_python = 6
pie_size = 3.14 
print(hello)
print(is_python_awesome)
print(days_in_python)
print(pie_size)

Use Python code to create the following variables. Those variables will be assigned the Starting Value as seen in the table below. 

After assigning each Variable with a Starting Value, use Python Built-in Functions to perform the conversion designated in the Convert to Type column.
Variable 	Starting Value 	Convert to Type
int_input 	"345" 	integer
pi_4 	"3.1415" 	float
hours_str 	40 	string
hourly_rate 	15 	float

After assigning all variables and performi

int_input = '345'
int_input = int(int_input)
print(int_input)
pi_4 = '3.1415'
pi_4 = float(pi_4)
print(pi_4)
hours_str = 40
hours_str = str(hours_str)
print(hours_str)
hourly_rate = 15
hourly_rate = float(hourly_rate)
print(hourly_rate)

Use python to produce code below that will create several named variables with the specified value using math operators:
Variable 	Value 	Type
x 	16 	integer
y 	3 	integer
xysum 	sum of x and y 	integer
xydiff 	difference of x and y 	integer
xyprod 	product of x and y 	integer
xyquo 	quotient of x and y 	float
xyintquo 	integer quotient of x and y 	integer
xymod 	modulus of x and y 	integer

After assigning all variables and performing the assigned math operations print each variable on a separate line in the order they appear in the table.

x = 16
y = 3
xysum = x+y
xydiff = x-y
xyprod = x*y
xyquo = x/y
xyintquo = int(x/y)
xymod = x % y
print(xysum)
print(xydiff)
print(xyprod)
print(xyquo)
print(xyintquo)
print(xymod)

Use python to produce code below that will perform the following:
    Create a variable named sentence and assign the value 'good for all'
    Turn the sentence variable into a list of individual characters and assign this to a variable named sent_list.
    Change the first (index 0) character in the list to 'f'
    Change the last (index -1) character in the list to '?'
    Combine the list into a new string with periods ('.') in between each character and assign the result to a new variable named output.
    Print output

sentence = 'good for all'
sent_list = list(sentence)
sent_list[0] = 'f'
sent_list[-1] = '?'
output = '.'.join(sent_list)
print(output)

Use python to produce code below that will perform the following:

    Create a variable named user_input that will read multiple numbers separated by spaces on the same line from the user.
        An example input may be:1 2 3 4
    Update user_input to change all spaces to a plus sign.
    Print the resulting string stored in user_input to the user.

user_input = input()
user_input = user_input.replace(" ","+")
print(user_input)

Use python to produce code below that will:
    Given an email address in email
    Convert the email into a list named lst
    The list will contain all individual parts of the email
    Example: email = 'alan.m.turing@genius.com' -> lst = ['alan','m','turing', 'genius', 'com']

email = 'alan.m.turing@genius.com'
email = email.replace("@",".")
lst = email.split(".")
print(lst)
