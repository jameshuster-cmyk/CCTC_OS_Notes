myList is a list. Using the provided function signature, return every other item in myList.

def everyOtherItem(myList):
    return myList[::2]
    
In a research and development database, record identifiers are formatted with a 3 character code representing a department, followed by the 5 digit employee id that made the entry, and ends in the subject category.
Create a function IDextractor that takes a string recordID and returns the employee id.

def IDextractor(recordID):
    return recordID[3:8]
    
myList contains a sequence of iterables. Print the length of the last item multiplied by the length of the first item.

print(len(myList[-1]) * len(myList[0]))

Call the built in length function with ("Bob", 32, "John", 64).

len(("Bob",32,"John",64))

Define the function FreeRange(start, stop). The function returns a range specified by the parameters with a step of +1 if start < stop. Otherwise the function returns a range with a step of -1 if start > stop

def FreeRange(start, stop):
    if start < stop:
        return range(start,stop)
    else:
        return range(start,stop,-1)
        
Create a range that correlates to valid indexes in mySequence. (HINT: How do you find how long a sequence is?) You do not need to define mySequence.

print(range(len(mySequence)))

You are given a sequence of items in the variable mySequence. Create and print a range object that would include every other index from the start of the sequence to the end. (HINT: how long is sequence?) You do not need to define mySequence.

Example: 
mySequence = [0,1,2,3,4,5]

Should print:
range(start, stop, step)     NOTE: The start, stop, and step should be filled in with the correct value to 

NOTE: The number of items in mySequence will be different with every test case. Your code should be dynamic enough to accommodate a varying number of items in the sequence. The sequence could be a list, a string, or any other collection of items.

x = len(mySequence)
print(range(0,x,2))

Define a function BillSummary() that repeatedly reads input from the user until the user hits return with no text input. Each line the user enters is a 3 character material code and a cost separated by a space. The function returns the grand total.

Example:
BillSummary()

With the following 2 input strings:
'AGR 1020.00'
'THG 3040.00'

Returns:
4060.0

def iCanCount(good):
    count = 0  # Initialize the counter outside the loop
    for letter in good:
        if letter == 't':
            count += 1
    return count  # Return the final count after the loop is finished

def BillSummary():
    total = 0
    while True:
        order = input()
        if order == '':
            break
        else:
            total = float(order[4:]) + total
    return total

Define a function BillSummary(items) that takes items as a list of tuple pairs. The first index in each pair is a material as a string, the second item is a total cost for that material as a float. For each item in items print material: total ensuring 2 decimal places. At the end of the loop, return the grand total (which is also a string formatted to ensure 2 decimal places).

Example Input:
BillSummary([('2x4',6000.00),('drywall',20000.00)])

Example Output:
2x4: $6000.00
drywall: $20000.00
26000.00

def BillSummary(items):
    total = 0
    for material, cost in items:
        print(f'{material}: ${cost:.2f}')
        total = total + cost
    return (f'{total:.2f}')

Use python to finish the function below that will perform the following:
    Read multiple lines from the user on standard input until an empty string is read.
    Return a list of all these lines
    Each line should be reversed from how it is read in.

Example:   If the following inputs were collected:
hello
hi
bye
goodbye
The list returned should be:  ['olleh', 'ih', 'eyb', 'eybdoog']

def reverseit():    
    bloblist = []
    while True:
        blob = input()
        if blob == '':
            break
        bloblist.append(blob[::-1])
    return bloblist

Use python to complete the function below that will perform the following:
    Given a mixed case string as parameter s
    Capitalize every letter with an even index within the string.
    Lowercase every letter with an odd index within the string.
    Return the resulting string.
    Example:
        leetString("ABCDEF ghijkl")
        Return: "AbCdEf gHiJkL"
        
def leetString(s):
    result = []
    for ind, char in enumerate(s):
        if ind % 2 == 0:
            result.append(char.upper())
        else:
            result.append(char.lower())            
    return ''.join(result)
nu
Use python to finish the function below that will perform the following:
    First, print out every even number on a separate line from provided parameter first to parameter last, inclusive.
    Next, print out every odd number from first to last, inclusive.

def evensandodds(first, last):    
    for num in range(first, last + 1):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            print(num)
    for num in range(first, last +1):
        if num % 2 != 0:
            print(num)

Use Python to finish the function below to read strings from a user until the user enters an empty string. The strings should be stored into a list that will be returned when the user enters an empty string.

Example: 
If the following strings are read from the user:
this
is
a
test
The returned list would be:
['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']

def user_io():
    lst = []    
    while True:
        usrinput = input()
        if not usrinput:
            break        
        lst.append(usrinput)        
    return lst

def user_io():
    lst = []
    strg = input()
    while strg:
        lst.append(strg)
        strg = input()
    return lst
    
Use Python to complete the function below to return a tuple of the multiples of 10 from 1 to 1000 inclusive.  
    
def make_tuple():
    return(tuple(range(10,1001,10)))    
    
Use Python to finish the function below to return a tuple of the given list (lst) split into two equally sized halves.
The given list will always consist of an even number of elements.

Example 1:
disect([1, 2, 3, 4])
Returns:  ([1, 2], [3, 4])
Example 2:
disect(['hello', 'world!'])
Returns: (['hello'], ['world!']) 

def disect(lst):
    midpoint = len(lst) // 2
    return(lst[:midpoint:1],lst[midpoint::1])
    print(midpoint)

def reverse_string(strng):
    return(strng[::-1])   
    
Complete the function, round_to_position, which takes a list of floats and returns a new list with the original floats each rounded to the number of digits of precision after the decimal point corresponding to the original float's position in the list.

Example:
round_to_position([1.999, 1.0993, 1.01999, 1.012999]
Returns: [2.0, 1.1, 1.02, 1.013]  
    
def round_to_position(lst):    
    rounded_list = []    
    for index, num in enumerate(lst):        
        roundednum = round(num,index)
        rounded_list.append(roundednum)        
    return rounded_list
    
Define the function MatrixProduct(matrix, multiplier) where matrix is a nested list and multiplier is a number.
The function should multiply each individual item found inside matrix by the multiplier and then return the updated matrix

Example:
